# Connected Systems and Devices lab 
This repository contains assignment(s) that I co-designed for the 'Connected Systems and Devices' lab at Malm√∂ University
, along with my initial solutions. This lab deals with programming Axis cameras and is given to master students in computer science, where I act as a tutor.
